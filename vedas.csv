Rigveda,1.1.1,Agnimile purohitam yajnasya devamritvijam.  Hotaram ratnadhatamam.,"Agnim i.e. agrani means first (agra) to lead (ni). The Supreme and Divine Energy is first to lead every living being and non-living things in the universe. That Supreme energy, referred to as God, is thus the core energy of our individual life too. Sun is the principal source of all thermic energy or fire. This element, fire, also is the first to lead and energize each and every particle of the universe. In society, all those, real and true leaders who serve others by burning their own selfish interests, desires and wealth etc. just to ensure welfare for all and without any ego considering the Supreme Divine as the real doer, are also like fire i.e. first to lead truly. ile : glorify, worship purohitam means beneficial (hitam) for the city or society (pur). Purohita also means one present before the creation. The Self-effulgent and Supreme Divine Power is the Supreme purohita as that Power was existing before the creation being the Creator Himself. Priest of sacrifice is also known as purohita. Sacrifice means complete dedication of one’s belongings and knowledge for the welfare of others yajnasya : for noble sacrifices without selfishness and ego devam : giver, illuminator ritvijam : in all times and all seasons hotaram : provider ratnadhatamam : bestower of splendid wealth - physical, material and spiritual. Physically, this body produces 7 elements (dhatus) from the food we consume   None None None None None"," What is agni, fire? Why do we worship God? I glorify and worship Agni, the Self-refulgent Lord of the universe. This Agni, the Lord Supreme, is first to be present everywhere and in every particle for common welfare.  That very power is present in all living beings and non-living things as energy. This individual energy of all creatures and particles is the first manifestation of that Divine Energy. Shatpath Brahmana (1.4.2.11) says God is fire (brahma agni) and the soul is also fire (atma va agni). Therefore, I worship my individual energy also as part of the Divine Supreme.  Thermic Energy released by fire is also first to lead every thing in the universe. It’s properties are colour, heat, light, velocity and disjunction etc. It’s the means of realizing everything. It’s the basic ingredient of all sciences, industries and therefore of everything required by human life. That is why fire, representing God, is considered as the Supreme Witness. Marriage among vedic followers becomes a permanent bond because both the husband and wife vow to remain united before the sacred fire burning in the yajnakunda.  God’s energy is full of all knowledge. Our inner energy also has the complete knowledge of our inner mind as to how much it is pure or impure, how much it is selfish or selfless. Therefore, I glorify both the energies as one and pray to increase it for the welfare activities. All these forms of agni are purohitas as they are engaged for the welfare of others and were present before the creation. If human being use this energy as per Divine planning, for the welfare of others, it will empower us from within to perform all yajnas, the welfare activities by sacrificing our own self. In return, the Divine Energy will provide splendid wealth (ratna, dhatu etc.) in all its dimensions, physical, material, mental and spiritual. Our body is the first ratna of its kind that produces seven tissues (dhatus) from the food we consume - plasma, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow/nerve, and reproductive tissue. In Sanskrit, they are rasa, rakta, mamsa, medas, asthi, majja, and shukra/veerya. All these tissues are produced only because of the energy within us.  ","  Firstly, we should always glorify and worship the Supreme Energy, God as our Father, Mother, Brother and Friend. This way, we would be able to enhance our energy. Secondly, to make sure that energy is not misused for endless and mad race for all selfishness. Rather, we should make sure that our daily activities are for the good of the family, workplace, and the society.  Thirdly, we should perform all activities without ego considering that the actual doer is the Supreme Energy of God. Then only you will get great treasures from the Divine Energy.  "
Rigveda,1.1.2,Agnih purvebhirrshibhiridyo nutanairuta.  Sa devan eha vakshati,"Agnih : the Supreme Lord and fire producing thermic energy idyah : is adorable as God and discoverable for varied uses scientifically purvebhi rishibhi : by the rishis, the divine personalities of the past, as they possess the real and true knowledge of that Supreme Energy as well as of the thermic energy hidden in every particle  Nutanaih ut : and by the present generation also who have new minds and undertake new activities to possess real and true knowledge by following the past rishis sa : He, the Supreme God avakshati : makes available devan : all knowledge, good senses, art and other divine virtues etc. eha : in the present life   None None None None None"," Why is Guru - Shishya tradition important? The relationship between the past and present generation should be both ways. The past generation should open up their knowledge and expertise for the guidance of the present generation and the younger people should follow elders in every field of activity, spiritual or relating generally to worldly life - physical, mental or material sciences. Only then a guru-shishya tradition would continue to ensure appropriate knowledge transfer. Such knowledge would increase day by day. Where everyone works like a father and a son, the Divine Power grants good senses and great knowledge to such a society only. Whereas, if this practice of interaction between past and present generation is discontinued, the results would not be good. Deep and complete satisfaction would be lacking in everyone. Gurus will feel sorry for they could not get appropriate disciples. Youngs would get frustrated because there is no one to guide them as father. Loveful relationship would become scarce. Confidence may be shaken. Frustration may develop resulting into mental unrest despite material success.  Vedas are transferred from generation to generation only through this guru-shishya tradition.  "," Customs, traditions and all knowledge must be transferred from generation to generation for the complete good of the society i.e. physical, mental and spiritual. This principle need to be applied in families, educational institutions, workplaces, social and political organisations. This would ensure prosperity and establish deep happiness at all levels of the society. This is called guru-shishya parampara, the tradition of teacher and disciple relationship.  "
Rigveda,1.1.3,Agninaa rayimashnavat poshameva divedive Yashasam viravattamam," Agnina : through Agni, the Supreme Divinity, our individual energy and the thermic energy i.e. fire rayim : knowledge and material wealth ashnavat : are made available poshameve : and the strength of body and mind increases dive dive : day by day yashsam : fame viravattamam : liked by all knowledgeable and powerful persons   None None None None None"," What is the source of our individual energy? The Supreme Energy of God, our individual energy and the fire, all need to be glorified with pious vows and deeds. Because, it is only through these energies we get all knowledge and material wealth. Only then strength in our respective fields will increase day by day, fame will result and it is liked and admired by the great and powerful people. But any mistake or lethargy in the use of such energies will result in devastation. Even wrong eating and living habits reduce energies.  Similarly, fire, an important element of nature, is the cause of all objects available to us for use. It should be used to enhance the well-being of all. Such diligent people are glorified and respected.  "," How to increase our individual energy? God is within us as physical, mental and spiritual energy. Connectivity with God increases these energies day by day. Just stay tuned to your inner energy and use it for beneficial activities. Family, workplace and the whole society, being the part of the universe, are feeding us. Apparantly these social units are our energy providers. Therefore, we must focus on strengthening these energy providers in return. Our energies would automatically increase.  A life disconnected to God means a disconnection from the source of our individual energy. This disconnection will result in reduction of our energy day by day.   "
Rigveda,1.1.4,Agne yam yajnamadhvaram vishvatah paribhurasi Sa iddeveshu gacchati,"Agne : The all Pervasive Energy, the Supreme Lord yam : those yajnam : sacrifices, welfare activities  adhvaram : that are undisturbed, non-violent, faultless and egoless vishvatah : from all sides paribhuh asi : surrounded, protected and taken care of (by agne) sa it : only that (yajna, welfare act) deveshu : good, genuine, needy and ultimately the Divine Power gacchati : reaches   None None None None"," How are sacrifices protected? This verse is like a divine assurance that the Supreme Agni would protect all acts of welfare for others that are without any type of violence, fault, ego projection or disturbance etc. Our vow should be very strong, determined and full of dedication. God certainly protects such acts. Only then our acts would be beneficial for the real subjects and establish a connectivity with the Supreme Energy. "," If our activities are like yajna, for the welfare of all, then automatically these are protected by the Supreme Energy. In all life activities, this principle can be observed. If one performs his/her duties like yajna - for the family, workplace or any other establishment, the concerned higher authorities protect such acts and the performer also in all possible ways.  "

The Supreme Energy is vibrating all throughout. Therefore, He is called a poet, composing and singing through His all-pervading energy and vibrations. That is why He is considered as God, the actual doer of all acts. He is the only permanent power. That is why hearing about Him is always full of astonishments. He is realized by the deep and continuous meditation and can be known through His divotees also. "," The Supreme Energy, God is within us and everywhere around. We do everything with the help of all powers and means given by Him. Therefore, He is the real doer of all acts. Similarly, in our family and workplace, we do everything with the powers and means given by our elders, superiors or employers. Therefore, consider those elders etc. as the real doer. This would make us egoless and would help in building an obedient, honest, humble image of our personality in the minds of elders and superiors. We would automatically get closer to thode high ups and enjoy their blessings.  "

That Supreme Power is Angirah, part of every particle of the universe. He Himself has created this universe completely for the welfare of all. Therefore, it is His rule of complete truth that when any person completely gives/donates all his belongings for the welfare of others, the Supreme Divine, finding such a person as His ardent follower in letter and spirit, takes care of him and does all good for him. "," God takes care of those who sacrifice for the welfare of His people. Guru Nanak Dev ji said - “putting food in the mouth of a poor means putting it in the treasury of God.” This principle applies in the family, workplace and anywhere in the society. When we show complete honesty, dedication and self-sacrifice towards our duties, we get complete protection from the seniors/elders.  "

It’s an inspiration and instruction for a meditative life. Every day and night, regularly, we must try to get closer to that Divine Energy with all our intellect and actions to realize various types of knowledge from the Supreme Father. We must focus on getting closer to Him. Every moment we must offer our humble salutations to God and worship Him. Just as food we eat provides nourishment to the physical body and knowledge nourishes our mental body, similarly meditational life every moment is required to realize unity with God at spiritual level.  "," Meditational life means 100% devotion 24 hours regularly in life. With closed eyes meditation for God, with open eyes all actions for God.

Rigveda,1.2.1,Vaayavaayaahi darshateme somaa arankritah  Teshaam paahi shrudhii havam ,"Vaayu : The omnipresent air, an element in nature which is considered as purifier.

Spiritually understanding this verse, vayu is God because just as God is omnipresent, vayu is also present everywhere in nature. God, being omnipresent, is very much within our body also. We can realise His presence by focusing on our breathe which is the pranic energy of our life. After deep inhaling, retain it for some time and focuss on it. This is the basic way of meditation. This retention stage is considered best for concentration on our inner energy and ultimately to progress on the path of God realisation. Physically also vayu being air element, our essential pranic force, needs a welcome in the body by retaining for sometime according to the capacity of lungs. Retention of inhaled air creates a pressure and strengthen our lungs, opens up alveoli and oxygenate the whole body thereafter. Thus, retention phase helps us to be healthy enough to perform all activities of life competently. Yogis who welcome air in this way are able to realise the importance of this great element of nature. Mentally, retention phase creates a soothing effect for the nervous system. During tension or trouble times, if one practices  deep inhaling followed by a sufficient retention phase, it will certainly result in raising nobilities in him to relieve him from tensions and troubles. With long practices over time, one can maintain a cooling mind permanently.  Air has a Divine purifying property. After purification no evils remain. Such practices of concentrating on air retention leads to the Divine realisation path. All worldly objects appear to be decorated with the presence of God, the Supreme Power. At physical and mental levels, the practitioner feels all nobilities in him at rise. Air brings both Divinity and nobility in our life. God is the protector of all worldly objects in the universe. Air as pranic energy protects our body. God and the air protect our nobilities and knowledge. God, being air, listens our prayers. We are also able to listen and to do all other acts in our life so long as we get air in our body as pranic force. Stoppage of this pranic air is called death and all activities are stopped.  "," :  Be Thankful to God,   	Tension Relieving Exercise God can be realised with every breath that we inhale, retain and exhale. Approximately above 21000 breathings every day are the free gifts of God. We must be thankful to and welcome God with every breath.  Scientific and yogic effect of retention phase can be experimented during tensions, quarrels or any tribulations of daily life. Your mind will cool down and you will change your attitude. Where there is God, there is only nobility and no ignobility.  Jahan Mahadev Vahan Basma Kamdev   "
